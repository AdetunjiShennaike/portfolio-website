									<h1>Seeing the world<br />
									With Wonder</h1>
									<p>I find greatness in all that I see, and strive to improve it within myself.<br />
									With this in mind, I work hard to create a better world for myself using the things<br />
									that I love to do as the driving force.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My whole life is based on expression. I want to create everything that pops into my head, from dance moves to music to art to software. My only worry for anything that I make is that it won't help someone, every time I create my goal is to have it help at least 1 person, if its uplifting, or inspiring, or allowing someone to see a new viewpoint, I want to be able to help 1 person every single time. I work to improve on the things that I love so that when I share them or create something new with them, I can reach someone. My life goal is to make something that has such an impact on the world that you won't be able to go anywhere in the world where someone hasn't experienced it, even if they don't know it was made by me, that's not as important as everything that is produced from just being able to experience it (dance performance, art piece, amazing photo, software, invention). <strong>I want to bring the world happiness!</strong></p>
								<p>I have lived such an eventful life, where I've been able to experience a large variety of viewpoints (several different Paradigms), because of the amount of knowledge I've obtained, I've been able to change the way I think and react along with every paradigm shift, learning more and more about what I want and what I want to stand for. I found the key to truly being in control is not controlling the variables around you, but being able to control how you react when things out of your control happen, so that is what I strive to change and work on the most. I want to be able to have a positive reaction to anything and everything that is thrown in my path, sometimes I may have to do things that are beyond tough, but this is where all of the important growth and experience will come from. Moving forward I believe I will experience more paradigm shifts and evolve into a better person than the one I dream of becoming.</p>
